Rewrite of [kouko](https://github.com/ckcr4lyf/kouko) in Rust, for better performance!

## Thanks

Many thanks to horsie and anon from Discord, both of whom were extremely helpful in helping me get more familiar with rust, and for offering their heads as I bounced ideas across them.

## Usage

The current release can be considered stable, but is not intended for use by others - it is not very customizable yet. That said, feel free to hack around with it if you like!
